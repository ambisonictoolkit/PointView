The PointView Quark : Read Me
========================
_An interactive view displaying a collection of points in 3D space._

Points are `Cartesian` points (optionally specified as directional pairs of
`[azimuth, elevation]`) rendered through a 3-D or orthogonal projection. The
model of points can be rotated or animated and the perspective can also be
manipulated. Points can be displayed with colors, individually or in groups, and
connecting lines can illustrate relationships between them.

The view and rotation controls are most conveniently changed through the UI
built into the view, though these methods and more are available for more
elaborate display of the points.

Installing
==========

Install via SuperCollider's command line:

>`Quarks.install("https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/PointView")`

It's recommended but not required that you also install the
[SphericalDesign]("https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/SphericalDesign")
Quark for the ability to form a triangular mesh across convex sets of points:

>`Quarks.install("https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/SphericalDesign")`
